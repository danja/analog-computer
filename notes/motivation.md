My own motivation:

Mostly curiosity, but there are potential practical uses :

* Their most common use is for solving differential equations and simulating physical systems. My calculus is really rusty, but it's something I should brush up on for the machine learning - lots of differentiation involved. Simulating things should be fun.

* For pre-processing signals from sensors (eg. seismic), you need some kind of analog circuitry. Being able to try different configurations easily will be handy. (Typically folks will do this kind of thing on a breadboard, but that's at a component level & fiddly. Analog computers have functional blocks: adder, muliplier, integrator etc. which can be plugged together).

* The functional blocks are essentially the same found in music synths, some potential or experimentation there. 
Also I want to try out a cheapo kind of construction, ready-made cases are really expensive - maybe use it for home made synths in the future. Main case is a cheapo wooden box, Amazon sell them for craft purposes (eg. cover with er, that collagey thing where you stick photos on things). Front panel is a sheet of a kind of board intended for making signs. Plastic sheet in the middle, thin layer of aluminium of the faces, on them a white surface. 

* The individual components of artificial neural networks are composed of essentially analog computing units (done digitally). Though you may have thousands in a typical nn, I think it might be useful to play with one or two in isolation.

* neuromorphic neural networks - in the brain use quite a different system than the computer ones. The computer ones are typically based around continuous signals, the animal ones pass around spikes. Could be some potential for useful experimentation.

* chaos! They're ideal for creating chaotic systems, something to play with. 

* I don't know about the viability of this. There's potentially a book in it. Dunno if I could keep myself motivated for long enough. There are only a couple of books on the things currently in print, they're generally considered obsolete technology (wrongly, imho). But a way around that would be to include interfacing with a modern computer, say through an Arduino. I reckon that would appeal to a lot of Makers (grr, I loath that term).

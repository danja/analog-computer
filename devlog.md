**2020-12-31** New Year's Eve (just another day at Mozzanella Polytechnic)

The other day an astronomer on YouTube I follow was talking about chaos in the the motion of the planets. I did a blog post - [A Quick Way to Visit the Stars](https://dannyayers.wordpress.com/2020/12/29/a-quick-way-to-visit-the-stars/). But this also prompted me to look at a bit more chaos theory.

One of the simplest systems for generating chaotic activity is Chua's Circuit. I found an excellent (if rather confusingly organised) site about this : http://www.chuacircuits.com/ It features an nice straightforward op amp-based implementation.
But how do you frame this in terms of an analog computer? Soon found a great little paper : [Simplest ODE Equivalents of Chuaâ€™s Equations](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~chua/papers/Pospisil00.pdf) (PDF). It can be done using 3 summers, 3 integrators and one nonlinear component, the 'Chua Diode'. This is an odd little thing, it's a function with a couple of kinks. Very simple to make with op amps.
But from what I can gather, the shape isn't particularly important, just as long as it is nonlinear - so I reckon it's probably doable using something like the log function I have planned for this machine.
I found it reminiscent of the [ReLU](https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/) activation function for neural nets. So naturally I next had a sniff around [The CNN Paradigm](http://nonlinear.eecs.berkeley.edu/raptor/CNNs/TheCNNParadigm.pdf) (PDF) by some guy called Chua. That's Cellular Neural Networks. 




**2020-12-15** First post here.

To date I've been putting notes directly inside the [design doc](https://github.com/danja/analog-computer/blob/master/anabella/design.md). From now on, I'll put fine-grained notes here, making the design doc effectively a snapshot.

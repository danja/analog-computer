# Analog Computer

I want to build an analog computer.

### Status

[Anabella](anabella/design.md) will be first proper attempt (loosely named after Lady Byron, Ada Lovelace's mother)

**2018-09-18** set up github repo, started typing up plans

*I've done quite a lot of background reading, gathered loads of references, now it's time to start putting things into practice*

### Motivation

* simulating seismic-like systems to (hopefully) inform [ELFQuake](https://elfquake.wordpress.com/)
* for use in music synthesis (also I want to try out a particular semi-modular construction idea, something to use later on analog synth components)
* brush up my calculus
* general curiosity - in particular experimentation with hybridization, using an Arduino to interface with PC, put it on the Web

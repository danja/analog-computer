# Analog Computer

I want to build an analog computer. [Design in progress](anabella/design.md).

### Status

**2020-12-08**
Wow, rather a long time since I last updated things here. Moderately good reason: about a year ago I realised I had too many projects on the go at the same time, so tried to focus on just one - [Chatterbox](https://github.com/danja/chatterbox).

But that isn't to say I've totally neglected this thing. Most visibly, I *may* have accumulated all the components I'll need.

The front panel - which effectively determines the overall design under the hood - is getting towards the point where I can start that side of construction. The top half here is the patchbay, bottom half controls.

I've also done quite a lot of research into potential circuits. My most immediate task there is to organise notes/docs around that. Then, I anticipate rather a lot of time on the breadboard.

**2018-09-25** overall [design](anabella/design.pdf) more or less worked out, started roughing out [front panel](anabella/front-panel.pdf) roughed out. Now working through individual modules, breadboarding. Soon will order case and some connectors, make sure everything will fit.

2018-09-18 set up github repo, started typing up plans

*I've done quite a lot of background reading, gathered loads of [references](anabella/reference), now it's time to start putting things into practice*

### Motivation

* simulating seismic-like systems and play with signal conditioning to (hopefully) inform [ELFQuake](https://elfquake.wordpress.com/)
* for use in music synthesis (also I want to try out a particular semi-modular construction idea, something to use later on analog synth components)
* brush up my calculus
* general curiosity - in particular experimentation with hybridization, using an Arduino to interface with PC, put everything on the Web
* [chaos](http://www.analogmuseum.org/english/examples/lorenz_attractor/) is fun!

*This also looks like it might have potential for fun : [Mathematical modelling of infectious disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease). The SIR model uses 3 differential equations, should test my calculus at least.*
